# Types of Mixtures

- Can see parts in some mixtures
    - ex. soil (rocks + decomposed plant and animal matter)
- Milk
    - Appears to be _homogeneous_
    - **actually is _heterogeneous_**
    - Lipid droplets + casein (protein)
- Salt (`NaCl`) + Water (`H2O`)
    - Sodium and chloride interspersed among water
    - Appears uniform throughout

## Solutions
- *soluble* = cable of being dissolved
- Process of sugar dissolving
    - Sugar molecules leave surface of crystals and mix with water
    - Eventually become uniformly distributed
    - **visible traces gone**
    - *solution* = homogeneous mixure of two or more substances in a single phase
    - Atoms, molecules, and irons are thoroughly mixed
        - Same composition and properties throughout

### Components of Solutions
- *solvent* = dissolving medium in a solution
- *solute* = substance dissolved in a solution
    - Usually of lesser quantity
- Examples
    - Ethanol-Water
        - Ethanol is *solute*
        - Water is *solvent*
- **Solute particles can not be seen and remain mixed indefinitely as long as _existing conditions remain the same_**

### Types of Solutions
- May exist as gases, liquids, or solids
- Many alloys are solid solutions
    - Brass from Zinc and Copper
    - Sterling Silver from Silver and Copper
    - **By choosing proportions, desirable properties can be obtained**

## Suspensions
- *Suspension* = a solution where the particles in a solvent are so large that they settle out unless the mixture is constantly stirred or agitated
- example: soil
- Form from particles over `1000 nm` in diameter (1000 times as large as atoms, molecules, or ions)
- **Can be separated using a filter**

## Colloids
- *colloid* = particle of intermediate size between solutions and suspensions (colloids are also known as colloidal dispersions)
- Examples
    - Cloudy color of muddy water
- Particles remain dispersed and appears cloudy
- Small enough to be suspended throughout the solvent by constent movement of surrounding molecules
- Parts
    - Colloidal particle = *dispersed phase*
    - Base = *dispersing medium*
- *Emulsion* and *foam* refer to specific types of colloids

### Tyndall Effect
- Many colloids appear homogeneous because individual particles can not be seen
    - Large enough to scatter light
    - *Tyndall effect* = when light is scattered by colloidal particles in a transparent medium
- Can be used to distinguish between solution and colloid
- *Brownian motion* is tiny specks of bright light moving rapidly in random motion under microscope (assuming direct application of bright light)

## Solutes: Electrolytes Versus Nonelectrolytes 
- Classified according to whether they yield molecules or ions
- *electrolyte* = A substance that dissolves in water to give a solution that conducts electric current
    - Sodium Chloride `NaCl` : Soluble in any ionic compound
    - `HCl` is highly electrolytes b/c forms `H3O+` and `Cl-`
- Solution containing neutral solute **does not conduct electric current** because it does not contiain mobile charged particles
    - *nonelectrolyte* = substance that dissolves in water to give a solution that does not conduct an electric current
    - Example: Sugar
    - **Must be a conducting path between electrodes** in order for it to conduct electricity
        - If this is not satisfied, it is a *nonelectrolyte*

# Solution Process
## Factors affecting Rate of Dissolution
- How do you quickly dissolve a **solid in a liquid**

### Increasing the Surface area of the Solute
- Dissolution process occurs at the surface of the solute
- Cna be speeded up if the surface area is increased
- Example: Sugar
    - Crusing sugar in cubes or large crystals icnreases surface area
    - **In general, the mroe finely divided a substance is, the greatr the surface area per usnit of mass and the more quickly it dissolves.**

### Agitating a Solution
- **Very close to the surface of a solute, concentration of a dissolved solute is high**
    - Shaking or stirring helps disperse and bring fresh solvent into contact
    - Similar effect to crushing a solid
    - **Contact between solvent and solute surface area is increased**

### Heating a Solvent
- **As the temperature of the solvent increases, solvent molecules and solute are more frequent**
    - Higher energy at lower temperature
    - Separate solute molecules from one another and disperses solvent molecules

## Solubility
- There is a point at which a solute can no longer disolve
    - For every combination of a solvent with a solid solute at a given temperature
    - Difficult to precisely predict
- Why
    - Molecules leave the solid surface and move at random
    - Some may collide with crystal and remain (*recrystallize*)
    - Eventually, molecules return at the same rate at which they go into solution
    - Reach dynamic equilibrium
    - *Solution equilibrium* - physical state in which the opposing processes of dissolution and crystallization of a solute occur at equal rates

### Saturated versus Unsaturated Solutions
- *saturated solution* = solution that contains the maximum amount of a dissolved solute
- Can tell if when more solute added falls to the bottom
    - If more water is added, then more will dissolve
- *unsaturated solution* = solution that contains less solute than a saturated solution under the existing conditions

### Supersaturated Solutions
- When a saturated solution of a solute whose solubility increases with temperature is cooled, excess comes out of the solution or when more solute is added
- *supersaturated solution* = solution that contains more dissolved solute than a saturated solution contains under the same conditions
- May remain unchanged for a long time if not disturbed
    - Once crystals begin to form, process continues until equilibrium is reesablished at a lower temperature

### Solubility Values
- **The _solubility_ of a substance is the amount of that substance required to form a saturated solution with a specific amount of a solvent at a specified temperature**
    - For gases, pressure must also be specified
    - Usually given as `grams(solu)/100g(solv)`

## Solute-Solvent Interactions
- `LiCl` is highly soluble in water, but gasoline is not
    - Gasoline is soluble wiht other things
- **Like disolves like** rough rule
    - Actual depends on type of bonding, polarity/nonpolarity, and intermolecular forces

### Dissolving Ionic Compounds in Aqueous Solution
- Polarity of water plays important role in the formation of solutions
    - Slightly charged parts of water molecules attract the ions in the ionic compounds
        - Surround them to keep separated from other ions
        - At crystal surfaces, water comes in contact with the solute
            - Attraction forces strong enough to draw ions away from crystal surface and into solution (see diagram `9` on page `411`)
            - process of *hydration*
            - Affected ions are *hydrated*
- When crystallized from aqueous solutions, some ionic substances form crystals that involve water
    - Known as *hydrates*
    - Retain specific ratios of water
        - Sampple formula: `CuSO4*5H2O`
        - Heating hydrate crystals can drive off water and leave salt

### Liquid Solutes and Solvents
- *immiscible* = Liquids that are not soluble in each other
    - Toluene and Water
- Nonpolar substances (fats, oils, greases, etc.) are generally **quite soluble** in nonpolar liquids
    - nonpolar liquids like `CCl4`, toluene, and gasoline
    - Only attractions between nonpolar molecules are **London forces**
- *miscible* = liquids that dissolve freely in one another in any proportion

### Effects of Pressure on Solubility
- Very little effect of liquids or solids in liquids
- Increase gas solubilities
- WHen a gas is in contact with the surface of a liquid, gas molecules can enter liquid
- As the amount of dissolved gas increases, some molecules escape and reenter the gas phase
- Equilibruium established when the rates of entry and exit of gases are the same
    - As long as equilibrium is undisturbed, solubility of gas is unchanged
- `gas + solvent <--> solution`
    - Increasing the pressure of the solute puts stress
        - Molecules collide with liquid surfaces more often
            - Offset by increase in the rate of gas molecules entering the solution
                - Increase in escape rate
                    - Equil. reestablished at higher solubility

### Henry's Law
- **The solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas on the surface on the liquid**
- *[recall]* when a mixture of ideal gases is confined in a constant volume at a constant temperature, each gas exerts the same pressure it would exert if it occupied the space alone
    - Assuming that the gases don't react, each gas dissolves to the extend it would if no other gasses were present
- *effervescence* = rapid escape of a gas from a liquid in which it is dissolved

### Effect of Temp on Solubility
- In gas sol: temp inc. usually decreases gas sol.
    - As temp inc. average kinetic energy of the mol. in sol. increases.
        - Greater number of solute molecules are able to escape and return to gas phase
- Liquids
    - Hard to predict
    - Often, increasing temp increases solub. of solids
        - However, equiv. temp increase can result in large increase in sol. for some solvents and only slight change for others

## Enthalpies
- Formation of solution accompanied by energy change
- During the formation of a solution, solvent and solute, particles experience changes in the forces attracting them to other particles
    - Before, solvents held together by intermolecular forces (solv-solv), solutes are held toget her by intermolecular forces (solute-solute)
        - Energy required to separate solute molecules and solvent molecules from their neighbors
- *solvated* = solute particle surrounded by solvent molecules
- *enthalpy of solution* = net amount of energy absorbed as heat by the solution when a specific amount of solute dissolves in a solvent
- In a gaseous state, molecules are so far apart that there are virtually no intermolecular forces of attraction between them
    - Solute-solute interaction has little effect on the enthalpy of a solution in a gas

# Concentration of Solutions
- *concentration of a solution* = measure of the amount of solute in a given amount of solvent or solution
- Solutions are sometimes are referred to as *dilute* or *concentrated*
    - *dilute* means relatively small amount of solute
    - *concentrated* means relatively large amount of solute

## Molarity
- *Molarity* - number of moles of solute in one L of solution
- Need to know molar mass in order to relate molarity to mass
- `M = mol/l`

## Molality
- *molality* = concentration of a solution expressed in moles of solute per kilo of solvent
- `m = moles[solute]/mass[kg   solvent]`
- Concentrations expressed as molalities when studying properties of solution s related to vapor pressure and temp changes
    - **does not change with changes in temp**
