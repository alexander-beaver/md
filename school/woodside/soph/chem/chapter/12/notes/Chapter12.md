 # Types of Mixtures
- Can see parts in some mixtures
    - ex. soil (rocks + decomposed plant and animal matter)
- Milk
    - Appears to be _homogeneous_
    - **actually is _heterogeneous_**
    - Lipid droplets + casein (protein)
- Salt (`NaCl`) + Water (`H2O`)
    - Sodium and chloride interspersed among water
    - Appears uniform throughout

## Solutions
- *soluble* = cable of being dissolved
- Process of sugar dissolving
    - Sugar molecules leave surface of crystals and mix with water
    - Eventually become uniformly distributed
    - **visible traces gone**
    - *solution* = homogeneous mixure of two or more substances in a single phase
    - Atoms, molecules, and irons are thoroughly mixed
        - Same composition and properties throughout

### Components of Solutions
- *solvent* = dissolving medium in a solution
- *solute* = substance dissolved in a solution
    - Usually of lesser quantity
- Examples
    - Ethanol-Water
        - Ethanol is *solute*
        - Water is *solvent*
- **Solute particles can not be seen and remain mixed indefinitely as long as _existing conditions remain the same_**

### Types of Solutions
- May exist as gases, liquids, or solids
- Many alloys are solid solutions
    - Brass from Zinc and Copper
    - Sterling Silver from Silver and Copper
    - **By choosing proportions, desirable properties can be obtained**

## Suspensions
- *Suspension* = a solution where the particles in a solvent are so large that they settle out unless the mixture is constantly stirred or agitated
- example: soil
- Form from particles over `1000 nm` in diameter (1000 times as large as atoms, molecules, or ions)
- **Can be separated using a filter**

## Colloids
- *colloid* = particle of intermediate size between solutions and suspensions (colloids are also known as colloidal dispersions)
- Examples
    - Cloudy color of muddy water
- Particles remain dispersed and appears cloudy
- Small enough to be suspended throughout the solvent by constent movement of surrounding molecules
- Parts
    - Colloidal particle = *dispersed phase*
    - Base = *dispersing medium*
- *Emulsion* and *foam* refer to specific types of colloids

### Tyndall Effect
- Many colloids appear homogeneous because individual particles can not be seen
    - Large enough to scatter light
    - *Tyndall effect* = when light is scattered by colloidal particles in a transparent medium
- Can be used to distinguish between solution and colloid
- *Brownian motion* is tiny specks of bright light moving rapidly in random motion under microscope (assuming direct application of bright light)

## Solutes: Electrolytes Versus Nonelectrolytes 
- Classified according to whether they yield molecules or ions
- *electrolyte* = A substance that dissolves in water to give a solution that conducts electric current
    - Sodium Chloride `NaCl` : Soluble in any ionic compound
    - `HCl` is highly electrolytes b/c forms `H3O+` and `Cl-`
- Solution containing neutral solute **does not conduct electric current** because it does not contiain mobile charged particles
    - *nonelectrolyte* = substance that dissolves in water to give a solution that does not conduct an electric current
    - Example: Sugar
    - **Must be a conducting path between electrodes** in order for it to conduct electricity
        - If this is not satisfied, it is a *nonelectrolyte*

# Solution Process
## Factors affecting Rate of Dissolution
- How do you quickly dissolve a **solid in a liquid**

### Increasing the Surface area of the Solute
- Dissolution process occurs at the surface of the solute
- Cna be speeded up if the surface area is increased
- Example: Sugar
    - Crusing sugar in cubes or large crystals icnreases surface area
    - **In general, the mroe finely divided a substance is, the greatr the surface area per usnit of mass and the more quickly it dissolves.**

### Agitating a SOlution
- **Very close to the surface of a solute, concentration of a dissolved solute is high**
    - Shaking or stirring helps disperse and bring fresh solvent into contact
    - Similar effect to crushing a solid
    - **Contact between solvent and solute surface area is increased**

### Heating
- **As the temperature of the solvent increases, solvent molecules and solute are more frequent**
    - Higher energy at lower temperature
    - Separate solute molecules from one another and disperses solvent molecules
