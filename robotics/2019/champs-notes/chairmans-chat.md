- Chairman's judges use a scoring sheet to keep track of teams that come through the room
    - Very similar to previous set of "eight questions"
    - What makes you special
    - Address all parts of the prompt using time wisely

## Visual aesthetic
- More important to have better content
- One situation
    - Presenter talking to the video as if it was a real presentation
    - Kept them in cadence
    - Person had to stay in sync with the video
    - Effective com tool but helped pace presentation

## Splitting info between video, presentation, and essay
- Essay should cover everything in presentation
    - Presenting and Essay team seem like separate teams
- Verbal presentation weighed more than verbal by some judges
    - Focus more on what happened more recently
- Essay first introduction
    - Exmpand knowledge thorugh the interview
    - Essay should give basic outline and presentation should expand
    - Q&A Allows for clarification
- Handouts
    - Notebooks and printed material don't get looked out until become finalist
    - Some judges who may have not seen presentations may consider you for an award... use books to learn about team quickly
    - One page summary + binder can be very useful for judges to talk about teams

## Metrics that teams have presented with
- Number of teams started
- Number of hours
- Number of people impacted
- Make sure to adhere to definitions of Chairmans
    - Accuracy more important than size
    - Be careful about words
- Account with audio, visual
- What is the impact of the numbers
    - Quantify the 8 points

## Teams winning are doing amazing things and outreach programs... how has it changed and how to compete?
- Small school in terms of participation of team
- Only can be best team that we can be
- Tell your story, not other stories
- Focus on your journey, not on the overall message
- **Comes down to impact of the team**
- Impression is mild change, impact is measurable, significant change
- **TELL YOUR STORY**
- Trends
    - Period of time when every team was doing things with 3D printers (for EI)
    - Almost all teams use 3D printers
    - Every Chairman's team felt like they had to do stuff internationally
        - Hard to tell **impact**
        - Sincere effort vs quantifying
        - You can have just as much impact locally
        - Density is a problem to help spread the word
            - Try to spread word more

    - Easy to cooperate and check info about objectives
    - Keep news and info accurate
    - Some teams have documented things signed by a team member and mentor

## Relative Impact
- Best way to represent that your impact is relative
- People are resources regardless of location
- Develop stages to improve

### Resources
- Teams journey
- 3132 started off as 20 people in a kitchen with a drill press
- Didn't know how they could afford to get to one US competition, much less two US competitions (Champs in Atlanta)
- **CHAIRMAN'S IS BABY STEPS**
- How can a make change, and then supersize?
- **CAN'T GET CHAIRMAN'S IN ONE YEAR**
- Try to change one person first
- Pick one part of _FIRST_ success and own it
- Convince people that you don't need to do entertainment or football, rather try to encourage them do STEM

## More impactful to see a couple of super impactful programs or mroe less impactful programs
- Judges interested in learning about hwat you have done given your resources
- If you can do more than one project, great
    - Get there with step-wise progress
- Teams say "what can I do"
    - No cookie-cutter answers
    - Teams are unique to who is on your team and what you can do
    - Whatever you can do to create impact

## Best way to communicate with teams and mentor them in other languages
- If you are not equipped to do outreach, don't
- Focus on what you are equipped to do

## How do you sort through what you want to put in your presentations and what you want to highlight?
- 3132 has a giant spreadsheet and figures out where things are best
    - Presentations are the best places for facts, impactful stories always in presentations
    - Different programs that did not need as much depth were quickly mentioned

## What makes a team stand out to the judges?
- Different things make a team stand out
    - No direct thing to say that this works
    - As listen to Q&A, figures out enthusiasm and if whole team is involved
- Look for unique
    - Everyone has a chance at winning
    - At champs level, look for story that says unique and different, and took _FIRST_ message in a different direction
    - What have you done that is unique is more important than saying how many teams you mentor
- It is okay to brag, judges will take in spirit of taking _FIRST_ in a positive direction


## Three stages of documentation
- Three binders
- Ever piece of documentation for entirety of team
- Overwhelm the judged
- Small book given to judges
    - Chairman essay
    - Graphics
    - Thunder downplay numbers to remove questioning
        - Breakdown numbers to prove that teir numbers are accurate

## How do you encourage people to get excited about outreach and what role do mentors play in the long-term perpetuation of outreach on your tema?
- Team culture and expectation
    - Force students to do outreach and nontechnical job
    - Make very clear what Hall of Fame means and that they are expected to continue to the process
- Mentors vs students
    - Create culture
    - Students follow mentors
    - Mentors get students excited

## Sustainable Mentors
- Google Sponsored and Google encourages them to fail
    - Create a lot of unsustainable programs and then try to make them sustainable or find something sustainable
- Don't want boring outreach

## Student leadership creating a culture
- Find mentor
- Create culture and if leaders take it seriously then others will take it seriously
- MAke it fun (good for technical people and nontechnical)
- OSS for callcenter
    - Done by software student
