# Effective First Strategies
# Steps
## Identify Limits
Not everyone can do everything, stay within limits
## You don't have to do everything
Some robots are doing very complex things

Do you **need** to do that
- If you can, there is value for that
    - Can shave cycle times

In this game, scoring is to right and left; bidirectional scoring is not super useful
- Do you **need** to do this

### 2056
- Canada
- No bidirectional scoring and handoff
- Have lots of resources
- Went simple
- *Outside means of a lot of teams*
- If a team has 30 units of robot functions, it is better to have 3 sets of 10 points (max) rather than 6 sets of 5
- Work on programming and drive practice more important than a complex robot
- Jack of all trades is a master of none

Not just about robots; need other EC and college

### Balance
- Universities do not really care about Extracirriculars
- **Grades are more important**
- People in high school can not do everything
- __*Do what you are passionate about*__
- _FIRST_ is designed so that you can take a smaller role
- Excel at passions

People love imposing limits on others
